        <h1 class="text-center">Code Of Conduct</h1>
        <p>By participating in Wiz-A-Thon Hackathon, you agree to abide by the following code of conduct.</p>
        <p>Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).</li>
            <li>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. As this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.</li>
            <li>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the hackathon, or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.</li>
            <li>The Organizer shall not be held responsible for any loss or damage done to intellectual property during the Hackathon.</li>
            <li>Participant is liable for any damage done to intellectual property or the venue during the Hackathon and need to pay the compensation</li>
            <li>Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon at the discretion of the hackathon organisers. </li>
        </ul>
